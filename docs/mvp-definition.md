# MVP Definition

## User-Visible Outcomes
- Users can **upload FIT files** and see a parsed activity summary.
- Users can **define planned workouts** and view their structure.
- The system can **match** a planned workout to an actual activity.
- Users can see **session analysis** results (ΔV/ΔI and label).
- Users can view **daily impulse** series and baseline Fitness/Fatigue/Freshness curves.

## Success Criteria
- **Upload → parse success rate** ≥ 95% for supported FIT files.
- **End-to-end latency** (upload to summary) under 30 seconds for typical files.
- **Auth-protected data**: users can only see their own data.
- **Core insights delivered**: ΔV/ΔI label is shown for matched sessions.
